"""
Ok here we go:
This is a recursive instantiate class.
The general principle is to instantiate a class twice to avoid making two distinct classes.
I needed to instantiate a python component with parameters but UnrealEnginePython
wouldn't let me do that.
Furthermore, I couldn't spawn the actor without instanciate the class and thus,
I couldn't spawn it with any parameter.

Let me explain myself :
In the main, I call the constructor of the class Object (for instance, or Floor, or Occluder),
which call the __init__ function of Object with at least 1 argument, world
which call the __init__function of BaseMesh with at least 1 argument, mesh_str.
In the Object __init__ function, I call actor_spawn,
which implicitely instanciate Object (yes, again)
BUT during the second instantiation, no parameters is given to __init__ (of Object and BaseMesh)
(this is why there is default values to every parameters of __init__).
Thus, if __init__ is called without any parameters, I know that it is the second instantiation,
so I don't spawn the actor again.
Once the object spawned, all I have to do is to set the parameters in the second instantiation
(location, rotation,...).
Et voilÃ  !

Occluder is the vertical plane thing that sometimes fall and sometimes get up by itself.
Sounds weird, it is.
It inherits from BaseMesh.
