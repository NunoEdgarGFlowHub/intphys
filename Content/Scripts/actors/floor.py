Ok here we go:
This is a recursive instantiate class.
The general principle is to instantiate a class twice to avoid making two distinct classes.
I needed to instantiate a python component with parameters but UnrealEnginePython
wouldn't let me do that.
Furthermore, I couldn't spawn the actor without instanciate the class and thus,
I couldn't spawn it with any parameter.

Let me explain myself :
In the main, I call the constructor of the class Object (for instance, or Floor, or Occluder),
which call the __init__ function of Object with at least 1 argument, world
which call the __init__function of BaseMesh with at least 1 argument, mesh_str.
In the Object __init__ function, I call actor_spawn,
which implicitely instanciate Object (yes, again)
BUT during the second instantiation, no parameters is given to __init__ (of Object and BaseMesh)
(this is why there is default values to every parameters of __init__).
Thus, if __init__ is called without any parameters, I know that it is the second instantiation,
so I don't spawn the actor again.
Once the object spawned, all I have to do is to set the parameters in the second instantiation
(location, rotation,...).
Et voilÃ  !

Floor is the plane thing which is the ground of the magic tricks.
It inherits from BaseMesh.

    __init__ instantiate the class

    world: UEngine world instance
    material: material of the actor (UObject). Default value: a random one in the relevant directory
    
    You can't pass the location, direction and so on of the floor as parameter
    because it is not needed, I gess
    If you need it anyway, help yourself
    Just for you to know, there is a formula in the location to make that the reference point 
    of the location is the center of the mesh, not the corner in the left back
    formula = 'the place where you want it to be' - (('size of the mesh' * 'scale') / 2
    so by default = 0 - (400 * 10) / 2
    the "- 10" for the yaw is because I want the reference point to be at the top side of the mesh,
    not in the middle of it.
    Disclaimer: if you change the size of the mesh, think about changing the formula
