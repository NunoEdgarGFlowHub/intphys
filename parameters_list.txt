This documents the differents parameters that make variability in the videos...

Fow now Block O1 only in test configuration (train is much more variable)

Note: Some textures come with custom friction and restitution coefficients.

Spheres:
- n_spheres [1, 3]
- for each sphere:
  - scale (random in [1.5, 2.5])
  - rotation (fully random on roll, pitch, yaw)
  - side on initial position (wrt camera, left or right)
  - force (constrained random in x, y, z) (for static spheres, force = 0)
  - texture (1 on 14 different ones)
  - mass fixed to 100
  - wrt init side, initial position constrained (x and y fixed, z random)

Occluders:
  - scale (random height and width, fixed depth)
  - motion speed (random in [10, 15])
  - pause between motions (random in [0, 1] for dynamic cases, in [0, 5] for static case)
  - texture (1 on 16 different ones)
  - location fixed

Camera:
  - location, rotation and focus fixed

Backwall:
  - randomly present (50% chance)
  - texture (same as occluders)
  - length (random in [1500, 4000])
  - depth (random in [-1500, -900]
  - height (random in [1, 10])

Floor:
  - texture (1 on 17)
  - fixed restitution (0.3) and friction (0.7) coefficients

Sky:
  - lights (1 or 2) with random position/rotation
  - cloudy sky randmly present (random 50%, if present the first light becomes the sky's sun disk)
  - lot of parameters fixed (density/speed of cloud, light color, etc...)
