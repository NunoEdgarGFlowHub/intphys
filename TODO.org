TODO list for the NaivePhysics project

* Deadlines
** For 2017-03-15
*** release of the challenge-1.0
    - A server with the benchmark (downloadable dataset)
    - The 2 first blocks, with train set, dev set (with evaluation) and test set (no evaluation)
    - An evaluation on the server (with registration)
    - A script to build test set/dev set from raw tests
*** release of a NaivePhysics-1.0 version as well
*** if possible, release the block C2 (shape consistency)
* Improvements
** In occluded tests
make sure there is no hit between main sphere and the background wall
** in status.json for tests
   do we need to specify when an actor is hidden (ie after a trick)?
   For now its coordinates are still registered even if it is no more
   visible.
** implement different classes of motion
   static, sliding, rolling, falling, walking (agent)
** run on a headless cluster
*** The problem is remote openGl rendering
- with DISPLAY=:0 that works remotely but corrupt the host's X server!
- http://www.virtualgl.org can be a solution
*** alternatively update to UE-4.14
- https://www.unrealengine.com/blog/unreal-engine-4-14-released
- New: Added "offscreen" video driver to SDL so the engine can now
  create GL context on headless machines not running any display
  servers (EGL is enough).
