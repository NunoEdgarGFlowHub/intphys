* for intphys-2.0 release
  Main objective is to replicate intphys-1.0 with the following
  scenarii: apparition/disparition, teleportation, changement de
  texture, changement de forme (en vol ou glissant)

** steps for test O1
*** static visible
- 1 actors
- then up to 3 actors
*** static occluded
- implement check run
*** dynamic visible
- implement the corridors and force
*** dynamic occluded
** TODO implement scenario classes
** TODO implement status.json
- include an actors field in status.json with mass, scale, physicals
- include also a magic_trick entry for impossible cases (frame number,
  nature of change)
** TODO on actors
*** lights
    - bug: increasing illumination in some scenes (when walls)
    - we want 1 skylight and from 0 to 2 (random) directional lights.
** TODO generate and validate a little database
* various bugs [1/2]
** Warning: Failed to set the rotation of Object_C_0
   bug in base_actor.set_rotation
** DONE Tools/build_shaders.sh
   CLOSED: [2018-03-19 lun. 18:02]
   Compiled shaders are not found when runnong the game in standalone mode.
** TODO packaged mode
   Fix the Tools/build_package.sh and the code base to run in packaged
   mode. (standalone binary independent of UE)
* desired features
** TODO reset the sky sphere rotation between scenes
** TODO implement different classes of motion
   static, sliding, rolling(?), falling, walking (agent)
** TODO run on a headless cluster
*** The problem is remote openGl rendering
- with DISPLAY=:0 that works remotely but corrupt the host's X server!
- http://www.virtualgl.org can be a solution
*** alternatively update to UE-4.14
- https://www.unrealengine.com/blog/unreal-engine-4-14-released
- New: Added "offscreen" video driver to SDL so the engine can now
  create GL context on headless machines not running any display
  servers (EGL is enough).
