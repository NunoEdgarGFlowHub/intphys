TODO list for the NaivePhysics project

* Deadlines
** For 2017-02-15
*** release of another block (block 1 dynamic or block 2 -> shape consistency)
    - a new train set, a new validation set
*** release of test set for the 2 blocks
** For 2017-03-15
*** release of the challenge-1.0
    - A server with the benchmark (downloadable dataset)
    - The 2 first blocks, with train set, dev set (with evaluation) and test set (no evaluation)
    - An evaluation on the server (with registration)
*** release of a NaivePhysics-1.0 version as well

* Bugs
** optimize checks in C1_dynamic_1
   - detect failures right after iterationType 5, not after the whole run!!
   - as done in C1_dynamic_2 block
** parallelization
*** test -j2 and -j3
*** fix the bug in balancing jsons
*** should be better/simpler with a randomization in python
    thus the json would have one entry per run, all parameters already fixed from Python

* Improvements
** more textures
   integrate the downloaded materials to the project
** scene variability
   - random cloud position/orientaion/speed
   - random light position/number -> variable shadows
** implement different classes of motion
   static, sliding, rolling, falling, walking (agent)
** format params.json to have spaces and new lines
** refactor status.txt
** run on a headless cluster
*** The problem is remote openGl rendering
- with DISPLAY=:0 that works remotely but corrupt the host's X server!
- http://www.virtualgl.org can be a solution
*** alternatively update to UE-4.14
- https://www.unrealengine.com/blog/unreal-engine-4-14-released
- New: Added "offscreen" video driver to SDL so the engine can now
  create GL context on headless machines not running any display
  servers (EGL is enough).
