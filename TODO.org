TODO list for the NaivePhysics project

* Deadlines
** For 2017-02-15
*** release of another block (block 1 dynamic or block 2 -> shape consistency)
    - a new train set, a new validation set
*** release of test set for the 2 blocks
** For 2017-03-15
*** release of the challenge-1.0
    - A server with the benchmark (downloadable dataset)
    - The 2 first blocks, with train set, dev set (with evaluation) and test set (no evaluation)
    - An evaluation on the server (with registration)
*** release of a NaivePhysics-1.0 version as well

* Bugs
** detect any collision with the camera
** detect superposition of the 2 occluders
** detect occluder or sphere in the backwall
* Improvements
** implement different classes of motion
   static, sliding, rolling, falling, walking (agent)
** refactor status.txt and params.json
   Ensure the status is correct (nb of agents, visibles or not)
** optimize checks in C1_dynamic_1
   - detect failures right after iterationType 5, not after the whole run!!
   - as done in C1_dynamic_2 block
** run on a headless cluster
*** The problem is remote openGl rendering
- with DISPLAY=:0 that works remotely but corrupt the host's X server!
- http://www.virtualgl.org can be a solution
*** alternatively update to UE-4.14
- https://www.unrealengine.com/blog/unreal-engine-4-14-released
- New: Added "offscreen" video driver to SDL so the engine can now
  create GL context on headless machines not running any display
  servers (EGL is enough).
