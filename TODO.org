TODO list for the NaivePhysics project

* variability
** random cloud position/orientaion/speed
** random light position/number -> variable shadows
** random camera position -> random position, constrained orientation
** for now all spheres/walls have the same material within a run, is it ok?
* configuration file
** should be better/simpler with a randomization in python
   thus the json would have one entry per run, all parameters already fixed
* blocks
** add a little delay (3 to 4 ticks?) because textures take time to be correctly displayed
   also the first image is all black!
** is the motion blur a problem?
   see https://answers.unrealengine.com/questions/17881/graphic-settings-disable-motion-blur.html
** a bug in C1_dynamic_1?
   Sometimes the main actor move slower in 2nd than in 1st iteration ???
** optimize checks in C1_dynamic_1
   -> detect failures right after iterationType 5, not after the whole run!!
   -> as done in C1_dynamic_2 block
* data dir
** format params.json to have spaces and new lines
** refactor status.txt
** bug: depth images are binary !!
** do we need depth for train samples?
   If so there is a bug because all actors are visible on depth but not in scene
* run on a headless cluster
** The problem is remote openGl rendering
** with DISPLAY=:0 that works remotely but corrupt the host's X server!
** http://www.virtualgl.org can be a solution
* parallel pathway
** fix the bug in balancing jsons
